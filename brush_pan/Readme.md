Simple Brush and magnetic pan for Voron350.

Notes:
- 6 magnets (3 on base, 3 on pan) are press-fit to dimensionally accurate (shrinkage adjusted ABS) and should not require glue.

- The holes are deep enough to sink them slightly below the surface, which is ideal to prevent magnet-to-magnet contact (can cause fractures).

- Install heatset insert (m3x4) into brush arm.  I use an m3x4mm set-screw from underneath to press into the bottom of the brush-head.

- Check the dimensions of your brush-head.  I roughly fit to the one I had...

- Mount to 2020 extrusion with m3x6 SHCS that should counter-sink flush with the face of the mount arm.

- the pan is intentionally elevated above the bottom of the plane of the 2020 extrusion to allow attachment of foam to prevent any potential vibration/resonance issues.  Ideally, the pan remains suspended by the magnets, but... your mileage may vary.
